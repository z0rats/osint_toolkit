"""Regression guard for SSRF-guard coverage (see roadmap: "Outbound SSRF guard
coverage audit"). `safe_get` in `app.core.security.ssrf_guard` is the required
entrypoint for any outbound request whose target host is (directly or
indirectly) user-supplied - see that module's docstring.

This walks every backend source file for raw HTTP-client construction
(`httpx.AsyncClient(`/`httpx.Client(`/`requests.get(` etc.) and fails if a
file doing so is neither on the reviewed allowlist below nor importing
`safe_get`. It exists so a new feature copy-pasting an existing HTTP-client
pattern - instead of reusing `safe_get` - fails a test instead of silently
reopening an SSRF hole.

If this test fails on a new file: either route it through `safe_get`, or, if
the target host is fixed/hardcoded (not user-supplied), add it to
`ALLOWLISTED_FIXED_HOST_FILES` below with a one-line reason.
